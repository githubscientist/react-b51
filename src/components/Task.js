/*
    Session Task - Profile Name Changes

    Implement a React component that allows users to change their profile name using the context api.
        - the component should consist of two parts: a component called App and 
        - a child component called Profile.
    
    The App component should be:
        - Import necessary dependencies
        - Create a context object using the createContext function from React.
        - Define a state variable called profileName using the useState hook and set its initial alue to an empty string.
        - Wrap the Profile component with the context provider component, passing the profileName state and its corresponding setter function as the value prop.
    
    The Profile component should:
        - Use the useContext hook to access the profileName state variable and its setter function from the context .
        - Render an input field where users can enter their profile name, with its value set to the profileName state variable.
        - Add an onChange event handler to the input field that updates the profileName state variable with the entered value using the setter function.
        - make sure to export the App as the default import and the created context in the App component.
